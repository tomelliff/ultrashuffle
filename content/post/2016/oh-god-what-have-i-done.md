In about 36 hours I'll be setting off from Wendover at the start of [Country to Capital](http://gobeyondultra.co.uk/events/country_to_capital_2016), kicking off my daft challenge of running an ultramarathon every month in 2016.

Just thinking about it now is filling me with a mixture of excitement and fear. But mostly fear. Because I'm really not very good at this whole running far thing.

It probably doesn't help that my training up to this point has been essentially nothing having only twice cleared the half marathon distance in training since the Snowdonia marathon way back in October. So the big plan of thinking I could follow up a positive marathon in October with regular 20+ mile long runs every weekend and even the odd back to back 20 milers in the run up to 2016 has completely fallen apart really.

Part of me is secretly thinking I'll be okay because I pretty much always fail to train properly for these things and instead just drag my sorry body through hours of pain because I'm stupidly stubborn. But the larger part of me knows that this year is going to be hell for me and my lack of training has only made this year kick off to about the worst possible start I could have short of picking up an injury.

I guess we'll find out how bad an idea this is tomorrow!
