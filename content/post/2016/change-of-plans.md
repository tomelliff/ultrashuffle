It's been a hectic last few weeks with Downslink and Laura's PhD viva in windy Dundee as well as buying and moving into our first house and I'm really feeling the effects of this year. With Laura's successful viva defence this has also brought with it a date for her well deserved graduation, unfortunately clashing with Wendover Woods.

I've scurried around looking for other races still open for November and come across the [Beacons Ultra](http://www.beaconsultra.com/), which describes itself as:

> "a mere 46ish mile mixed trail/mountain/canal/road run around the magnificent Brecon Beacons in the middle of November, when climatic conditions can vary quite considerably. In the events 9 year history the race has taken place in everything from sparkling Sunshine through to minus 8 degrees, with obligatory rain and mist thrown in to remind the athletes that they are running in Wales in all its glory"

So probably a fair bit harder than a gentle trot around the Chilterns with a looped 10 mile course which is what I had planned. It's also a week sooner, giving me a bit less time to recover from my knee that has been troubling me since Downslink a couple of weeks back.

I'm now getting to the point in the year where my body has pretty much had enough of it all and as I look back through my races on Strava and see my tumbling pace I know I've completely over stretched myself but I just keep telling myself that I only need to put myself through 2 more races and should all be done inside 20-25 hours more running between the Beacons Ultra and [Run to the Castle](http://codrc.co.uk/run-to-the-castle).
