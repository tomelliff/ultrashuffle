So it's been 4 weeks since Shires and Spires and after taking a much needed rest from running I've done pretty much nothing since. In a normal year this wouldn't bother me all that much as I've always been slow to recover from these kind of races, both physically and mentally. Unfortunately I don't really have time to take a break from the running this year because the races just keep coming and coming. Even with this longest break between races this year I'm now 4 weeks away from my second hardest race of the year - [Lakeland 50](http://www.lakeland100.com/the-lakeland-50).

Just yesterday one of my colleagues pointed out how I was "the laziest active person" he knows and he has a pretty good point. This year I've lurched from ultramarathon to ultramarathon and just about knocking together a couple of 3.5 mile runs home from work, the odd 6 to 8 mile run with my barely active running club and very occasionally a 10+ miler on a rare weekend that I'm not feeling completely and utterly exhausted.

I know the lack of training is probably going to be my downfall at some point but that doesn't somehow give me the energy I need to be able to get out and put the mileage in that I should be doing and somehow this makes it all the worse.

Having managed to get a slowish 11 miler in this morning I joked that if I do 20 miles next weekend, then 30 and then 40 that leaves me well prepared for Lakeland 50 in 4 weeks time. Other than the fact that Lakeland 50 apparently has a few hills in it. And I almost certainly won't actually put in anything like that kind of mileage in training. Because, as mentioned, I'm lazy.
